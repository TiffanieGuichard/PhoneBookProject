# PhoneBookProject
## How to interact with the PhoneBookProject:
When you run the code, you will see the different options available. You shall choose one of these 6 possibilities by entering the number corresponding to it. 
* Your first option is to create a new contact info. By entering “1” the program will then ask you the Name of contact, its Phone Number and its Email. 
  * Note: If the entered name of contact already exists, then the program will ask you if you want to overwrite the already existing information.
* Your second option is to delete a contact. By entering “2” the program will then ask you the Name of contact you would like to delete. 
  * Note: If the name does not exist in the phonebook, the program will tell you that the desired number does not exist.
* Your third option is to modify a phone number. By entering “3” the program will then ask you the name of the contact which you want to modify their phone number, and asks you to enter the new phone number to overwrite the old one. 
  * Note: If the name does not exist in the phonebook, the program will tell you that the desired number does not exist.
* Your fourth option is to modify an email. By entering “4” the program will then ask you the name of the contact which you want to modify their email, and asks you to enter the new email to overwrite the old one.
